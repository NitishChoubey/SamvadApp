# SamvadApp

A modern Android application project built with Kotlin and Gradle Kotlin DSL.

“Samvad” means “conversation/dialogue.” This repository provides a clean, ready-to-run Android app scaffold you can open in Android Studio or build entirely from the command line using the Gradle Wrapper.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:
- Android Studio (latest stable recommended)
- Android SDK and platform tools
- JDK 17 (recommended for modern Android Gradle Plugin)
- A device or emulator running a supported Android version

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NitishChoubey/SamvadApp.git
cd SamvadApp
```

Open in Android Studio:
- File > Open… > Select the `SamvadApp` directory
- Let Android Studio sync Gradle and index the project

Or use the Gradle Wrapper from the command line (no local Gradle install needed).

---

## Build and run

Build all modules:
```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

Assemble the debug APK:
```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

Install the debug APK on a connected device/emulator:
```bash
./gradlew :app:installDebug
```

Run the app from Android Studio:
- Select a device/emulator
- Click “Run” (Shift+F10)

---

## Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

Run Android instrumentation tests (requires emulator/device):
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

Optional quality tasks (if configured in your `app` module or root build):
```bash
./gradlew lint
```

---

## Configuration

Signing (Release builds):
- Create or use an existing keystore
- Add a signing config to the `app` module’s `build.gradle.kts`
- Keep secrets out of VCS; prefer `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` for:
  ```
  MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=/path/to/keystore.jks
  MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
  MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=*****
  MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
  ```

Gradle/JVM tuning:
- Adjust `org.gradle.jvmargs` and other flags in `gradle.properties` as needed

Environment-specific values:
- Consider using BuildConfig fields or a local `.properties` file loaded in Gradle for non-secret configuration

---

## Troubleshooting

- Android SDK components not found
  - Open Android Studio > SDK Manager and install required platforms/build tools
  - Accept licenses:
    ```bash
    yes | "$ANDROID_HOME"/tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses || true
    ```

- Gradle sync/build errors
  - Ensure JDK 17 is selected in Android Studio (Settings > Build Tools > Gradle > Gradle JDK)
  - Clear caches:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew --stop
    ./gradlew clean
    ```
  - In Android Studio: File > Invalidate Caches… > Invalidate and Restart

- Device not detected
  - Enable USB debugging on the device
  - Verify with:
    ```bash
    adb devices
    ```
